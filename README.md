# Multimodal-Skin-Cancer-Classification-ML

In this project, we trained and evaluated ML models to predict diagnostic classes (including benign and cancerous) of skin lesions. This dataset contains the code we wrote and used to do so. Our cleaned and pre-processed data and models are available at https://data.world/zhao993059/multimodal-skin-cancer-classification-data, and the original dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/marmal88/skin_cancer.

Specifically, we divided our code across 5 Jupyter Notebooks. _skin_cancer_eda.ipynb_ contains our code for performing exploratory data analysis and producing initial data visualisations. _skin_cancer_data_preparation.ipynb_ contains our code for cleaning and pre-processing the data (loaded using a library) and exporting the resulting feature, label, and pre-processing object files. _skin_cancer_model_environment.ipynb_ contains our code for training initlal models across three families—one-vs-rest logistic regression, decision trees, and feedforward neural networks—loading the aforementioned feature and label files and exporting one best fitted model from each family. _skin_cancer_analysis_evaluation.ipynb_ contains our code for evaluating the aforementioned best models, loading their files. Finally, _skin_cancer_demo.ipynb_ contains our code for performing a demo with our one-vs-rest-logistic regression with elastic regression model, loading that file along with our pre-processing object files.
